# Gloom

Gloom is a hardcore language for building extreme systems, designed from the ground up for getting real work done. Unlike other languages that supposedly provide safety and reliability (aka bureaucratic paperwork), Gloom embraces the idea that there's an element of danger in most things worth doing. Hence all computations in Gloom have side effects. So little as printing an object changes its state. In blending operations and consequences, the Gloom language forces developers to become acutely mindful of their actions and the immediate repercussions those actions have on their systems.

Gloom's philosophy hinges on the belief that programming, much like life itself, is messy, unpredictable, and filled with risks. Rather than hiding from these realities, Gloom programmers are encouraged to master them. This brutal approach may not be for the faint of heart, but for those who crave raw, unfiltered interaction with their code, Gloom offers an unparalleled experience.

This is in early stages. This repository is more of a playground to experiment with the language's semantics before going all-in on implementation.
